The application has a good logical layered design where in each layers have distinct roles and 
functionalities. The most of the application code follows a good coding standards and naming conventions that is readable
and easy to support and maintain.

From coding perspective I have few minor observations that can be cosidered in future development:

1. Always use style sheet to control the look and feel of the pages. Never specify font name
and font size in any of the pages. Use appropriate style class. This will help in
changing the UI of the application easily in future.



2. Avoid using hardcoded/magic strings. Instead create a static class with constants, or an enum if you can.
